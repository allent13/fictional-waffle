                    <p>Oh no! Various types of breakfast foods are trying to overthrow the waffle's position as the superior option. Stop them in their tracks by tossing dishes at them in order to plate them. You can move the waffle by using the WASD keys and throw dishes by pressing the spacebar. Earn points for every enemy you plate and show them who's the Breakfast Boss by racking up a high score! But be careful, enemies that hit you will knock off your strawberries! And if you lose all your strawberries it's Game Over!</p>
                    <p>(also try not to think too hard about why things are like this. It's only fiction after all.)</p>
