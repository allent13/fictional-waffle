# fictional-waffle (actual name TBD)

fictional-waffle is a 2D side-scrolling shoot em' up game where the player controls a character that fires at oncoming enemies. The player will be able to move up or down and shoot at approaching enemies. If an enemy reaches the player character, they will take damage. If the player takes too much damage, it's game over. You win if there are no more enemies / you reach the end of the stage.
